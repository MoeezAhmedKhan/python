# Matplotlib is used for data visualization

# Problem Statement:
# Suppose we have monthly sales data for a whole year and we want to find out which month had the highest sales.
# Manually checking and comparing the numbers would be time-consuming and prone to errors. 
# By using Matplotlib, we can create a visual representation of the sales data, 
# making it easy to identify trends and quickly determine the month with the highest sales.

# Data Visualization - The process of representing raw data visually using charts or graphs, 
# such as bar charts, line charts, etc., to make it easier to understand and analyze.
